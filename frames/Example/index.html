        <p>The purpose of this project is to create a space to showcase and test, review and showcase design web applications frames.</p>
        <p>Think of it as a replacement of Photoshop (PSD docs) where frames normally are separated by layers and where each layer visualise a page/state of the application. </p>
        <p>This tools aim: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Prototyping and presentation of web applications</li>
            <li>Prototyping of new features</li>
            <li>Promoting the Front End first approach and use of the final tools from start and then continuously working with the application UI and design instead of relying on PSD docs.</li>
            <li>Reviewing and updating the current HTML markup and CSS</li>
            <li>CSS Overview</li>
            <li>Desktop tool for testing responsive design, different viewports and media queries</li>
        </ul>

    <div class="page" data-frame='{"title":"How it works"}'>
        <h2>How it works</h2>
        <p>Creating a new project to showcase should be a piece of cake if you're familiar with HTML and CSS. </p>
        <p>Just design your project by creating regular html markup, apply your CSS and stack all the pieces into one HTML file.</p>
        <p>The Pathos pages are then created by adding a data-frame attribute to the wrapping element you want to highlight. Like this...
            <code> div data-frame='{"title":"Example"}' </code>
        </p>
        <p>That's the basics and pretty much all you need to apply in order to create the separation. You can then add additional javascript if you want to demonstrate different states depending on user actions.
            Actually you can continue to implement the other parts of the application from here and use use this tool as an overview.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="page" data-frame='{"title":"Install & Setup"}'>
        <h2>Install / Setup </h2>
        <p>Clone the <a href="https://github.com/ImanimalXI/pathos" target='parent'>project repository</a> from Github if you want to run from a local environment. </p>
        <p>Put the project files in your localhost and open the root index.html file in your browser.</p>
        <p>The default location for project frames is the <i>/frames</i> sub folder. Create a folder here to start a new project.</p>
        <p>The new folder should at least include a index.html (for the project markup) and a package.json file with the meta data.</p>
    </div>

   <!-- <div class="page" data-frame='{"title":"Another Example"}'>
        <h2>External page example</h2>
        <p>You don't have to checkout and run this project from a local machine. If you have your project design on a external server somewhere then load the page from the
            <strong>Load frames from url</strong> input.</p>
        <p>I've added a simple example that's located at CodePen, URL. Paste the url in the input to load the project or select the project from the left side menu</p>
    </div>-->

    <div class="page" data-frame='{"title":"How to use"}'>
        <h2>Usage</h2>
        <p>The project page includes a set of functions to read  projects and check the different project pages. </p>
        <p>Pathos also include a set of default mobile devices to check different layouts. </p>
        <p>A CSS section will display the project css with a simple filter box for code overview. </p>
        <p>The slideshow toggle will start an iteration between the project frames. </p>
